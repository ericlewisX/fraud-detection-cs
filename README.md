Will update when have time.

The site was modified from a site called OMNIFOOD built during the course https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/

There are sales on Udemy ALL the time! If you're paying more than $20 for a course, you made a mistake. Also, most courses, if you scroll down on the course list, will bundle two similar courses for $30 or something similar. Those are the courses I usually get.
